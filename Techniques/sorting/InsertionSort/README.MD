In the insertion sort, an ieration of the input array takes place, during this iteration a group of numbers in the input array starting from the left or right(usually from the left) is considered and progressively increases in size as the initial iteration is carried out. This group is then compared with the current element in the loop starting from the last elemennt in the group, the comparison is done by another iteration of the elements in the group starting from the last element and ending on the first element. 
If the current number in the input array's loop is less than the current element being compared to in the group, it swaps positions with it, this is done as the we iterate in the elements on the group. This ensures that the largest elements keep being pushed to the right and the smallest elements in the comparison keep being pushed to the left
