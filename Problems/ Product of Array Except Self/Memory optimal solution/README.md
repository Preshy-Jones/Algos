Building up from our solution involving prefixes annd suffixes, we implement a solution in  which instead of using 3 arrays including prefix,suffix and output arrays, we use only one single output array. 

As we did witht the prefix array we initialize the first element of the output array as 1, this is because the product of the array except the first element is always the product of all elements to the right, so the best imaginary or virtual number number we can attribute to the left is 1 because any other value(0 or >1 or <1) will affect the product of the elements to the right. Since we already have the value of the first element in the output array, we then iterate over the input array starting from the i=1(the second element) and compute the prefix of each element by multiplying the previous element in the output array with the previous element before the current element in the input array. This is done until we reach the last element in the input array.

To compute the output array, We initialize a multiplier R=1 to serve as a replacement for our output array. We iterate over the output array,On each iteration we update the value of the current index element of the output array to the product of R and the value of the current index element  of the output array which like the suffix array starts from 1 and store it in the outp, we then update the value of R to the produt of R and the index element in the input array, this new value of R is the suffix or product of the elements to the right of the next element in the iteration.
